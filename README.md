Hi, I'm Blu! 🌱

My journey into tech started with a deep interest in how information is shared, preserved, and experienced. After studying liberal arts and working in art spaces, I realized that the challenge wasn’t just about access—it was about clarity in a world flooded with content. This sparked my transition into coding, where I now build tools designed for clarity, accessibility, and thoughtful engagement.

When I’m not coding, I’m tasting life — through curiosity, creation, and and everyday exploration.
