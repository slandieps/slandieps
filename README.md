Hi, I'm Blu! ðŸŒ±

My journey into tech started with a deep interest in how information is shared, preserved, and experienced. After studying liberal arts and working in art spaces, I realized that the challenge wasnâ€™t just about accessâ€”it was about clarity in a world flooded with content. This sparked my transition into coding, where I now build tools designed for clarity, accessibility, and thoughtful engagement.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m tasting life â€” through curiosity, creation, and and everyday exploration.
